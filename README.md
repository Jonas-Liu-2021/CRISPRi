With .fasta sequence, .gbk annotation and CRISPRi data, this pipeline could generate ploycistron status / GO encichement results / KEGG encichment results / COG classification / volcano plot / genome circular plot / homologues status with E.coli.
The detailed annotation came from eggNOG-mapper while the polycistron status came from Operon-Mapper. The homolugues status with E.coli was generated by SonicParanoid2.
